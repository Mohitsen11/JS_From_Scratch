// Interpreted means which executes code line by line

function fun1(){
    let student = "Mohit";
    console.log(student);
}

console.log("Mohit");
// console...log("We are super cool!"); 
console.log("byee");

// if js is pure interpreted language then it must print Mohit before printing the error but it gives error first and doesn't print anything on the screen
