// we'll see how can we display the given input(data) to the user as an output

// there is an in-built function provided by js 
// which is console.log()

console.log("mohit");

// different console.log() will print input with a newline

let fruit = "apple";

console.log(fruit); // fruit will get printed in newline

// we can print multiple values in a single line by giving multiple inputs in a single log function
console.log("Iphone14", 130000, "Red");
